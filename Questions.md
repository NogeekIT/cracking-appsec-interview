	- Typically, when hashing passwords,
4. Where would you use fast hashing algorithms?

5. What are different types of encryption? Give an example/use-case of each? Name the encryption algorithms that you have used.
	- Symmetric
	- Asymmetric
6. A developer needs to use the AWS KMS service. What recommendations would you provide?
	- Consider key storage, whether in an HSM or in AWS internal storage; selecting between CMKs and AWS managed keys; and key rotation and revoking keys, securing access to keys

7. Have you used any key management services? How does KMS work?

8. Explain end-to-end encryption. Give an example of an app using e2e encryption.

2. What are the various authentication methods for web applications you have worked with?
   - Cookie-Based Authentication.
   - Token-Based Authentication.
   - Third-Party Access (OAuth, API-token)
   - OpenID Connect (OIDC)
   - Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
4. Explain token based authentication vs session/cookie based authentication?

5. Do you think one authentication method, like single sign-on, or multifactor authentication, cookie based, API key based is more effective than another?

3. Explain authorization. A developer needs help with a new authorization module or schemeâ€”what would you suggest?
	- JWT's
	- ACLs
	- IAM

7. What is the difference between Auth0 and OAuth?

8. What do you understand about a federated identity infrastructure?

9. What are the IAM solutions and tools you prefer working with the most?

10. Have you ever implemented IAM solutions or products before?

11. How do you rename IAM policies in cloud systems?

12. How do you trace a user's activity with IAM?

13 What is the distinction between IAM policy and IAM role?

14. Difference between SOP and CORS?

# Software Supply Chain Security

1. What is Software composition Analysis?
   - SCA tools used before, stale dependency vs top-level dependency
   - Integration challenges
   - ASPM
2. How is software supply chain security different from software composition analysis?
   
3.

6. What challenges could you face while performing a security assessment of a web application?

**Case Study**

Scenario:
Your organisation has a critical legacy web application that has been in production for over a decade.
While it still serves its purpose, its security posture is outdated and vulnerable to modern attack vectors. You've been tasked assessing and remediating the application's security vulnerabilities.

Initial Assessment:

* How would you approach the initial assessment of the application's security? What tools and techniques would you employ?
* What specific vulnerabilities would you prioritise for immediate attention, given the application's age and complexity?

Risk Assessment: 

* What factors would you consider when determining the severity and priority of vulnerabilities?
* How would you conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to understand the potential impact of vulnerabilities on the business?

Remediation Strategy: 

* Outline a remediation strategy that balances security improvements with the need to maintain the application's functionality.
* How would you address legacy components or dependencies that may be difficult to replace or update?

Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC):

* How would you integrate secure coding practices and automated testing into the application's development and maintenance processes?
* What specific tools or frameworks would you recommend for implementing a secure SDLC?

Incident Response:

* Develop an incident response plan for the application, considering potential security breaches and data leaks.
*  What key stakeholders would be involved in the incident response process, and what are their roles and responsibilities?
